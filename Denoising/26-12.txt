Replace the zeros with Nan get intermidate output
After col/row missing sample est we take avg, instead of avg if we add the image is more bright
Map to 2-d denoising code

Pixel-wise classification

Boundary of sepearation image segementation
gradient applied on level set

gradient is equivalent to detectiong an edge to get boundary

Guassian filter is for smotthening 
watershed algorithm

if edge info not clear this algorithm will fail
