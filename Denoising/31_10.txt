no of pixels correspoinding to gray level --- yaxis
power of gamma correction
good contrast image = distributed across all the gray levels
no of occurances -= intensity/pixel info
sum all the values of hist = m*n = no of pixels
histeq gives better image

Go through

piece wise contrast streching 
histogram matching

-------------------------------------------------
3,4,5,1,1,2, tells no of pixels belonging to gray level
write own function (imhist) to plot own histogram

floor(cdf*(grayscale level{2^n-1})) will give s (grayscale info of shifted level using cdf) 
this shifting will be the histogram equalisation operation, we perform this to make the input image to push to all the levels of gray, only the distribution of the pixels chnage, also the frequency will(may) also change

difference between histeq and hist mapping

key point descriptors
image stiching (match)
orthomosaicing 

why sigular value decomposition not eigen value decomposition

Low filter / hIgh filter 
Low pass filter/ High pass filter
2 kind of coeff Approximation coeff / detailed coeff

detailted coeff = reconstruction filter or interpolation 


Downsample
Upsample 
Translation donme through convolution
Taking alternate value of outupt of conv is downsampling it by 2 times
