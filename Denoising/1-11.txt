Wavelet Transform
Sacle invariant/shift invariant must be captured
2 bamd filter(2 frequencies)
Low filter / hIgh filter 
Low pass filter/ High pass filter
2 kind of coeff Approximation coeff / detailed coeff

detailted coeff = reconstruction filter or interpolation 


Downsample
Upsample 
Translation donme through convolution
Taking alternate value of outupt of conv is downsampling it by 2 times 


Pixel replication(base algorith for zooming (imresize))
spatial resolution
temporal resolution
sprectral resolution
radiometric resolution


"HAAR" filter 2 coeff 
"Debacuius" filter db filter db4 4 coef db6 6 coef db8 8 coeff

convolution followed by downsampling 
perfect matching filter	

Extended to M-band
Spatial size(lngth of signal) N = 2^j j=lvl of decomposition 

Reconstruction and synthesis of signals
