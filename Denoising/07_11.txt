M band wavelet system
for 2 band wavelet system
j= 2^N-1

D=== Decomposition/analysis
R=== Reconstruction/synthesis

2 band wavelet
D_Lowpass, D_Highpass
R_Lowpass, R_Highpass

            ---------a1
x(n)N=8------
            ---------d1

Number of levels of decomposition is 3 since 2^3=8

bcs of the double shift orthogonality we go for alternate samples

h(n)=(-1)^n*g(n)

Generalize for n level decomposition

4 level decomp it will store 4th axxprox level and all detail levels 
Own code as function file call it based on noumber of levels


Nested spaces reconstruction using the scaled versions (One lie within the other)
Phi(2^0*t)=Phi(2t)+Phi(2t-1)
Phi(2t) scaled version of phi(t) 

Phi(2^jt)=Phi(2^(j+1)t)+Phi(2^(j+1)t-1)

Generalised notation
Phi(2^j*t-k)= Sum n=0 - N-1  h(n)*Phi(2^j+1*(t-k)-n)

Similarly derive the high pass
h1(n)=(-1)^n*h(N-1-n)
High pass is derived form the low pass.

Prove that psi(t)=psi(2t)-psi(2t-1) is wrong
Chcek if scaling bases are orthogonal to wavelet bases

As j increases scaling space will become narrow

K is translation j is scaling, analogous to convolution K is shift
2*K is double shift so 2K is double shift orthogonality

Vj is scaling space j denostes which space we are in

Increasing j we are moving to finer and finer spaces

--(objective metrics)?

fourier bases cannit be scaled ,, in wavelet we can scale value

psi csnnot beexpressed with psi itself
Nested spaces not true in cases of psi

Sum of filter coeff = sqrt(No of fiter band) sqrt(2) in case of haar4
