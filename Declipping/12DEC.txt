y= noisy signal
D= 2nd order diferrence coedff
x= denoised outpit
\lamda= control parameter to give weightage to 2nd term

if y=x its min but if y is noisy the output can be x noisy
to cancel out the noise we have the 2nd term


y = known samples
v= estimated samples
St Sct is not unknown can be constructed based on y
length of the signal 5 
we know 1st ,2nd an d5th 
Sx is 1 where we knwo sampke value  k x n (known x length)
Sc is corresponding to missing samples (2 x 5) 

D(Sty+Sctv)
D is coming to ensure smotheness while estimation
Sty = known sample information
number of unknown < number of knowna 	

Find the places where the signal is actuallly known



2D

y had dim M x N i have n signlas each column has M samples

Missing sample estimation m times rows
n times for columns

detection = segmention problem where cat is presemt
